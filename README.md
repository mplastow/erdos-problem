# erdos-problem

## C++
The C++ program `erdos` generates and caches prime numbers at program startup for the prime checks, but doesn't do any visualization aside from printing to the console. Prime generation and coordinate prime checking are both very fast, even for large (1000 x 1000) grids of large numbers (~100,000,000).

The easiest way to interact with the program is by treating it like a script: edit the variables indicated by the `EDIT` comments in `main()`, then build and run.

### Dependencies
Any recent C++ compiler. The code was compiled with a C++20 compiler, but C++11,14, and 17 probably work as well.

The `primesieve` library is used to generate primes quickly. For more information: [[primesieve on GitHub](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/)]
To get `primesieve` on Ubuntu, use `apt install primesieve`

### Building and running
`erdos` was authored on Ubuntu. It will probably work on macOS and Windows, but I haven't tried those platforms.

#### Linux
Building and running `erdos` is done by running the simple build script in the `cpp` directory:
```
cd cpp
sh build.sh
./erdos
```

### To-do list
* Improve grid data format so that it is easier to interact with correctly
* Write tests to support correctness in calculation
* Design and write a backtracking algorithm to determine all possible paths given a grid spec
* Put a visualization frontend on the program with a GUI
* Improve speed of prime checks by eliminating some duplicate checks

## Python
The Python script `visible_point_grid.py` has been translated from the C++ code using ChatGPT, with some cleanup afterward. It uses the following libraries:
* `primePy` to precompute primes
* `numpy` to reshape the coordinate data for plotting
* `matplotlib` to plot the grid

The Python script has plenty of room for performance improvement: it takes about 110 seconds to precompute primes up to 1,000,000 on my machine. On the other hand, it visualizes the grid with a nice GUI.

## Lean
All code in the `lean` directory was generated by ChatGPT and has not been modified beyond changing some of the import statements. There is no guarantee it compiles, nor that it proves anything if it does compile.
